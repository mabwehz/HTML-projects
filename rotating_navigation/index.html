            <small>The G.O.A.T</small>
            <p>
                Eiichiro Oda (Japanese: 尾田 栄一郎, Hepburn: Oda Eiichirō, born January 1, 1975) is a Japanese manga artist
                and the creator of the series One Piece (1997–present). With more than 490 million tankōbon copies in
                circulation worldwide, One Piece is both the best-selling manga in history and the best-selling comic
                series printed in volume, in turn making Oda one of the best-selling fiction authors.

            <h2>Early life</h2>
            <p>
                Eiichiro Oda was born on January 1, 1975 in Kumamoto, Japan. He said that at the age of four he resolved
                to become a manga artist in order to avoid having to get a "real job". His biggest influence is Akira
                Toriyama and his series Dragon Ball. He recalls that his interest in pirates was probably sparked
                by the popular TV animation series titled Vicky the Viking.
            </p>
            <h2>Career</h2>
            <p>
                At the age of 17, Oda submitted his work Wanted! and won several awards, including second place in the
                coveted Tezuka Award. That got him into a job at the Weekly Shōnen Jump magazine, where he originally worked as assistant manga artist/assistant to Shinobu Kaitani's series Suizan Police Gang before moving to Masaya Tokuhiro on Jungle King Tar-chan and Mizu no Tomodachi Kappaman, which gave him an unexpected influence on his artistic style. At the age of 19, he began working as an assistant to Nobuhiro Watsuki on Rurouni Kenshin, before winning the Hop Step Award for new manga artists. Watsuki credits Oda for helping create
                the character Honjō Kamatari who appears in Rurouni Kenshin.
